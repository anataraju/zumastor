Building Zumastor Testing Images with PTXdist
---------------------------------------------

This document describes how to build QEMU-bootable Zumastor test
images with PTXdist.

=== Pros ===

 * The build process is lean, fast, and easy to set up.  There is no
   need to set up DHCP, TFTP, and HTTP servers, and a complete build
   from source (which needs to be done only once) takes 12 minutes.

 * The resulting image is also lean and fast.  The image is 48MB in
   size (32MB root filesystem, 16MB empty partition for testing) and
   boots in about 20 seconds.

=== Cons ===

 * Everything is built from source, so adding new software to the
   image requires more work than "apt-get install".

 * PTXdist images target embedded systems and thus do not always
   follow standard Linux system organization conventions.

=== Build ===

 1. Download PTXdist 1.0.0 from the Pengutronix website.
    http://www.pengutronix.de/software/ptxdist/index_en.html
    Apply the patches in cbtb/ptxdist/patches.

 2. Download OSELAS Toolchain 1.1.0 from the Pengutronix website.
    http://www.pengutronix.de/oselas/toolchain/index_en.html

 3. Install ptxdist; then build and install the
    i586-unknown-linux-gnu_gcc-4.1.2_glibc-2.5_linux-2.6.18
    OSELAS toolchain.

 4. Change to the Zumastor top-level trunk directory.

 5. Run "./buildcurrent.sh kernel/config/qemu".  If you do not use the
    kernel/config/qemu file, make sure to includ all necessary
    features and drivers in the kernel.  The kernel needs to be able
    to boot without initrd.

 6. Run "cbtb/host-scripts/ptxdist-image.sh" which builds a ptxdist
    image with Zumastor software from the .deb packages in the build/
    directory.  You should rerun this script whenever you have built
    new Zumastor software packages.  The first run takes 12 minutes,
    and subsequent runs take less than 10 seconds.

 7. Boot build/zumastor.img with QEMU.  The login prompt will show up
    on the serial console.  Use /dev/hda2 (16MB, partition type
    already set to Linux LVM) for Zumastor testing.
