<H3>Snapshots versus the origin.</H3>
<P>When a snapshot is taken, it is empty; all reads
and writes get passed through to the origin. When an origin write
happens, the affected chunk or chunks must be copied to any extant
snapshots. (This chunk is referred to as an "exception" to
the rule that all chunks belong to the origin.) The make_unique()
function checks whether the chunk needs to be copied out, does so if
necessary, and returns an indication of whether that happened.</P>

<H2>Startup.</H2>
<p>The Zumastor system of processes is started as a side effect of creating a
Zumastor volume by use of the "zumastor define volume" command.  Zumastor starts
the user-space daemons (ddsnap agent and ddsnap server), then commands the
devmapper to create the actual devices; this eventually results in a call
to the kernel function ddsnap-create() through the constructor call from the
devmapper.  This function creates the control, client and worker threads,
which proceed as outlined below.</p>
<p>Generally, when it is started the ddsnap agent just waits for connections;
it sends no messages and all further operations are performed on behalf of
clients.  During processing it gets a new connection, accepts it, allocates
a client structure and adds it to its client list.  It adds the fd for
that client to the poll vector and uses the offset therein to locate
the client information later.  After startup the ddsnap server (ddsnapd)
operates the same way.</p>
<UL>
	<li>dm-ddsnap client ("incoming" thread) starts and initializes, sends
	NEED_SERVER to agent, blocks on server_in_sem.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Agent gets NEED_SERVER, calls have_address() (which unconditionally
		returns true), then calls connect_clients():
		<ul>
			<li>Connects to client address.</li>
			<li>Sends CONNECT_SERVER and fd to dm-ddsnap control.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li>ddsnapd starts and initializes, sends SERVER_READY to agent, then
	waits for connections.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Agent gets SERVER_READY, calls try_to_instantiate() to send
		START_SERVER to ddsnapd (which initializes its superblock).</li>
		<li>Agent calls connect_clients():
		<ul>
			<li>Connects to client address.</li>
			<li>Sends CONNECT_SERVER and fd to dm-ddsnap control.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li>After agent sends CONNECT_SERVER (by either path):
	<ul>
		<li>dm-ddsnap control gets CONNECT_SERVER, gets fd, ups
		server_in_sem (unblocking client), sends IDENTIFY over
		just-received server fd, ups recover_sem (unblocking
		worker).</li>
		<li>ddsnapd gets IDENTIFY, sends IDENTIFY_OK to client, passing
		"chunksize_bits." <i>(To "identify" a snapshot?  What does this
		mean?)</i></li>
		<li>dm-ddsnap client gets IDENTIFY_OK:</li>	
		<UL>
			<li>Sets READY_FLAG.</li>
			<li>Sets chunksize_bits from message.</li>
			<li>Sends CONNECT_SERVER_OK to agent.</li>
			<li>ups identify_sem, which allows ddsnap_create() to return.</li>
		</UL>
		</li>
		<li>Agent receives CONNECT_SERVER_OK, does nothing, is happy.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>dm-ddsnap worker starts, blocks on recover_sem.  When unblocked
	by CONNECT_SERVER operation:
	<ul>
		<li>If the target is a snapshot, calls upload_locks() to clear
		outstanding releases list entries, send UPLOAD_LOCK and
		FINISH_UPLOAD_LOCK messages to ddsnapd (which does nothing
		with them) and move any outstanding entries on the "locked"
		list to the "releases" list.</li>
		<li>Calls requeue_queries() to move any queries in the "pending"
		queue back to the "queries" queue for reprocessing (since
		ddsnapd has restarted and has therefore lost any "pending"
		queries).</li>
		<li>Clears RECOVER_FLAG, ups recover_sem (again??), starts
		worker loop.</li>
	</ul></li>
</UL>
<h2>Locking</h2>
<div class="indent">
<p>When a chunk is shared between the origin and one or more
snapshots, any reads of that chunk must go to the origin device.  A write to
that chunk on the origin, however, may change the shared data and must therefore
be properly serialized with any outstanding reads.</p>
<p>Locks are created when a read to a shared chunk takes place; a snaplock is
allocated if necessary and a hold record added to its "hold" list.  When a
write to such a chunk takes place, we first copy the chunk out to the snapshots
with which it is shared so that future snapshot reads no longer must lock the
chunk.  We then check whether the chunk has already been locked.  If it has,
we create a "pending" structure and append it to the eponymous list on the
snaplock, thereby queueing the write for later processing.  When all
outstanding reads of that chunk have completed, the chunk will be unlocked and
the queued writes allowed to complete.</p>

	<li><B>chunk</B>:
	A unit of data in a Zumastor volume, measured in bytes, which may not
	(and probably will not) correspond to sector, block or page sizes;
	Zumastor manipulates the contents of a volume in "chunk"-sized units.</li>
	<li><B>exception</B>:
	A chunk that no longer exists solely on the origin, but has been
	modified after a snapshot was taken, so that a copy of the old
	contents has been made in the affected snapshot(s).</li>
	<li><B>snaplock</B>:
	A data structure that describes a list of read locks associated with
	a chunk associated with a snapshot but actually shared with the origin
	for which there is a read outstanding.</li>
