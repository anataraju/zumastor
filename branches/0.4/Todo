Open issues for release 0.4:

  * Automated test harness not yet functional

  * ddsnap transmit sometimes gets connection refused from downstream listen

  * Clean up ddsnap log output

  * Get rid of redundant used vs free accounting fields

  * Accounting fields are still thought to get out of sync under certain
    conditions involving unexpected restart

  * unmount of origin device sometimes fails due to mountpoint busy for
    unexplained reasons, a possible nfs kernel bug

  * Need a cleaner fix for the dmsetup remove/ddsnap delete use count race

  * In theory, retrieving the chunk changelist from ddsnapd can trigger a
    memory deadlock.  Need to make this impossible.

  * More work remains to be done to prevent low memory vm deadlock

  * Is the congestion_wait bugbear really dead and buried?  Try some more
    to make it manifest

  * upgrading packages is not properly supported yet because the old packages
    we distributed were broken and need to be purged from the system before
    we can reliably remove old packages without forcing recreation of the
    snapshot store and/or volume database
