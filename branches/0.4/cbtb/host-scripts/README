These are the components of the continuous build server that are run on the
host machine and set up each run of the build and test as new releases of
the archive are made.  As they are running on the host machine and have
access to host resources, networks, etc, they should not automatically
updated from the repository, and should be given a cursory inspection to be
sure they are safe to run in your environment.  They will be running
unprivileged in a dedicated account.

0) Set up the testenv infrastructure in cbtb/host-setup/

1) Create a new, dedicated build user on the host machine.
  adduser --disabled-password zbuild

2) Make sure zbuild is authorized to run tunbr, any accelerated device
nodes, and has a tftpboot directory.  eg.
   chmod 4711 /usr/local/bin/tunbr
   adduser zbuild uml-net
   adduser zbuild kvm
   adduser zbuild kqemu
   mkdir -p /tftpboot/zbuild/ubuntu-installer/i386
   chown -R zbuild /tftpboot/zbuild
   chmod -R 755 /tftpboot/zbuild

3) Become the test builder
   su - zbuild

  a) create an ssh key without a passphrase
    ssh-keygen -P '' -t dsa

  b) check out a read-only copy of the zumastor repository 
    svn checkout http://zumastor.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ zumastor

  c) copy and examine as required the scripts this directory to the home
     directory, to prevent directly running scripts from this repository on
     the host system without supervision.
    cp zumastor/cbtb/host-scripts/*.sh ~

  d) Create a dapper-i386 template image
    cd zumastor/cbtb/host-setup/
    tunbr ./dapper-i386.sh

  e) Launch the continuous build
    cd ~
    ./continuous.sh >continuous.log 2>&1 </dev/null &
