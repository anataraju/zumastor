How to install Zumastor from a tarball in two easy steps

1. Build and install ddsnap

Additional packages ddsnap needs:

  * development headers for libpopt (at build time)
  * dmsetup command (at run time)

To build ddsnap from source:

  * check out the svn tree according using the instructions on
    zumastor.googlepages.com

  * cd to ddsnap and make; sudo make install

Now it gets a little ugly because we haven't cleaned up the kernel install
from tarball procedure yet.

  * Generate the kernel patches, leaving the ddsnap files in ddsnap/patches/2.6.21.1/AUTO.ddsnap.files.patch

       make genpatches

  * Obtain a 2.6.21.1 kernel tarball from kernel.org and unpack it

       wget http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.21.1.tar.bz2
       tar -xjf linux-2.6.21.1.tar.bz2

  * Apply all the kernel patches to the 2.6.21.1 kernel:

       cd <root of the 2.6.21.1 kernel tree>
       for patchfile in ddsnap/patches/2.6.21.1/*; do patch -p1 <$patchfile; done

Run make menuconfig, config drivers -> md -> dm-ddsnap to build as a
module, or preferably as a built-in for better debugging.  While in there,
turning on debugging -> include debug symbols would be a good idea, plus
stack frame for more accurate traceback.  Build and install.
	Required config options are:
		CONFIG_DM_DDSNAP
	Recommended options are:
		CONFIG_IKCONFIG_PROC
		CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ
		CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO

    make
    sudo make install

2. Install Zumastor

  * cd to ../zumastor and sudo make install

This will set up everything except the SysV init scripts (rc2.d, rc3.d
etc) and the kernel.

Reboot to the new kernel.  Manually try zumastor start and zumastor stop,
verifying there are no error messages.  If that is fine, then add zumastor
start and zumastor stop to the appropriate SysV init directories.  Reboot
and zumastor should be running.  It will not be doing anything, because
you have not yet defined any volumes.  However you can confirm it started
properly by doing:

   tree /var/run/zumastor

and you will see the skeleton zumastor database using:

   tree /var/lib/zumastor

At that point, our documentation for using zumastor itself should become
useful.  If there are any bumps, or omissions in my quick instructions here,
please let me know, or you can just wait for Nov 1 to roll around and we
will take care of it.
