Running the cbtb tests locally, before you submit:


Be on a 32-bit kernel, or a very recently patched 64-bit kernel (bugs in
ptrace affect 32-bit UML on 64-bit hosts).  

Configured sudo so you can use it.  Speed and avoiding extra layers and
software like fakechroot that aren't yet widely available.

Make sure you have an ssh key in your ssh daemon.  ssh-add

Add CONCURRENCY_LEVEL := 2 or more to /etc/kernel-pkg.conf to speed up
kernel builds on multi-core systems).  Kernels and packages are built in the
host environment, so the host must be a Debian-derived system, and probably
no newer than Debian/etch and have the zumastor/ddsnap/kernel build
dependencies installed.  See builddepends.sh.
