<h2>Ubuntu walkthrough on VMWare Player</h2>
First, install vmware player on your machine.  (If you're using Ubuntu,
it might be as simple as <tt>apt-get install vmware-player</tt>.)
<p>
Second, download a vmware image with Ubuntu preinstalled.
I'm not sure what the best is, but the oddly-named site 
<a href="http://www.thoughtpolice.co.uk/vmware">www.thoughtpolice.co.uk/vmware</a>
seems reasonable.  
<p>
Choose the Ubuntu Server 6.06 download, click
on the "fast torrent!" link, and tell Firefox to open the torrent file;
this should pop up kTorrent to download the 189 megabyte image.
The image is several files zipped together, so unpack it with
<pre>
$ mkdir ~/vmubuntu
$ cd ~/vmubuntu
$ unzip ~/ubuntu-server-6.06-i386.zip
</pre>
<p>
Third, start up vmware player (Applications / System Tools / VMWare Player)
and tell it to load the .vmx file in the directory where you unpacked the vmware image.
<p>
Fourth, inside vmware, log in to the virtual ubuntu box (using the username and password
from the site where you downloaded the image).
<p>
Fifth, inside vmware, download and install dmsetup and the Zumastor packages, e.g.
<pre>
$ sudo apt-get install links dmsetup
$ mkdir tmp
$ cd tmp
$ links zumastor.org
[download the kernel image, zumastor, and ddsnap packages.  Don't forget to let the downloads finish!]
$ sudo dpkg -i *.deb
</pre>
(This currently fails with Ubuntu 7.10, which is why this walkthrough uses 6.06.)
Ignore the warnings about deleting symbolic links.
<p>
Sixth, reboot the virtual machine:
<pre>
$ sudo reboot
</pre>
Booting currently fails with the error "Unable to find volume group 'Ubuntu'"
and drops you into an emergency shell after a minute.
<p>
Seventh, send annoyed email to the zumastor developers, asking them to try this walkthrough :-)
