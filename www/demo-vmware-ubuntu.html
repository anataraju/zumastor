<h2>Ubuntu walkthrough on VMWare Player</h2>
First, install vmware player on your machine.  (If you're using Ubuntu,
it might be as simple as <tt>apt-get install vmware-player</tt>.)
<p>
Second, download a vmware image with Ubuntu preinstalled.
I'm not sure what the best is, but the oddly-named site 
<a href="http://www.thoughtpolice.co.uk/vmware">www.thoughtpolice.co.uk/vmware</a>
seems reasonable.  I chose the Ubuntu Server 7.10 download, clicked
on the "fast torrent!" link, and told Firefox to open the torrent file;
this popped up kTorrent, which downloaded the 189 megabyte image quickly.
The image is several files zipped together, so I unpacked it with
<pre>
$ mkdir ~/vmubuntu
$ cd ~/vmubuntu
$ unzip ~/ubuntu-server-7.10-i386.zip
</pre>
<p>
Third, start up vmware player (Applications / System Tools / VMWare Player)
and tell it to load the .vmx file in the directory where you unpacked the vmware image.
<p>
Fourth, inside vmware, log in to the virtual ubuntu box (using the username and password
from the site where you downloaded the image).
<p>
Fifth, inside vmware, download and install the Zumastor packages, e.g.
<pre>
$ sudo apt-get install links
$ linkx zumastor.org
[download the kernel image, zumastor, and ddsnap packages]
$ sudo dpkg -i ddsnap<TAB> zumastor<TAB> kernel<TAB>
</pre>
This currently fails.
<p>
Sixth, send annoyed email to the zumastor developers, asking them to try this walkthrough :-)
