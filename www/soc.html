<h1>Zumastor Summer of Code Ideas</h1>
<img src="linux1.png" class="floatRight" alt="Zumastor Logo">

We would love to have a Summer of Code student contribute
to Zumastor.  
<p>
Here are a few quick ideas:

<h2>Remove 64 snapshot limit</h2>
aka <a href="http://code.google.com/p/zumastor/issues/detail?id=6">issue 6</a>.
<p>
Language: C<br>
Skills required: Linux kernel coding<br>
Difficulty: 2 Months?
<p>
Zumastor's <a href="http://code.google.com/p/zumastor/source/browse/trunk/ddsnap/ddsnap.c">ddsnapd.c</a> uses a 64 bit bitmask 
(e.g. <a href="http://www.google.com/codesearch?q=snapmask+package%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fzumastor%5C.googlecode%5C.com&origq=snapmask&btnG=Search+Trunk">search for "snapmask"</a>) 
internally to say which snapshots a particular block belongs to.
This limits us to supporting 64 snapshots.  Dan Phillips has an idea
for switching to using extents instead of a bitmap, and estimates
this would take about two months to get working.

<h2>Add support for online Resize</h2>
aka <a href="http://code.google.com/p/zumastor/issues/detail?id=20">issue 20</a>.
<p>
Language: C<br>
Skills required: Linux kernel coding<br>
Difficulty: 2 Months?
<p>
The ext3 filesystem and lvm2 both have support for online resizing;
see e.g.
<a href="http://jbopensrc.wordpress.com/2007/10/10/growing-a-lvm2-ext3-partition/">this recipe</a> or
<a href="http://www.causton.net/areca.shtml">this recipe</a>.
Zumastor already has support for offline resizing.
It should be possible to add support for online resizing, and ideally
to hook into LVM2's interfaces so the recipies above don't need
modification.


<h2>Easy way for users to access snapshots e.g. in Nautilus</h2>
aka <a href="http://code.google.com/p/zumastor/issues/detail?id=37">issue 37</a>.
<p>
Language: any universally deployed scripting language (bash / perl / python)<br>
Skills required: moderate scripting<br>
Difficulty: 1 months
<p>
The first order of business is to provide a simple commandline utility
that lists the snapshots of a particular directory or file,
in a way that could be extended to work with
any kind of snapshot (zumastor, netapp, samba, ...).
That should only take a week or two.
<p>
The next order of business is to use that utility inside Nautilus
and/or Konqueror plugins to let a user right click a file,
choose 'Previous Versions', and see the old versions of the file.
This shouldn't require any C/C++ coding at all.
Here's one <a href="http://tech.shantanugoel.com/2008/03/09/ubuntu-tip-extending-nautilus-scripting-your-way-to-ui-bliss.html">tutorial on how to extend Nautilus</a>.
There are already several such snapshot plugins for Nautilus 
(see e.g. <a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/project/jds/tasks/zfs_nautilus/">here</a>), 
but they are specific to a single type of snapshot, whereas we
want to support several.
