Introduction
------------
This document will explain what Zumastor is, how it differs from
other snapshot and replication tools, how to install it,
and how to use it.

What is Zumastor?
-----------------
It has been difficult to convince users of commercial NAS applicances
to switch to Linux.  In particular, some commercial NAS boxes have
had better support for snapshots and remote replication than Linux.
Zumastor is an effort to fix that.

Snapshots
---------
Snapshots can be useful as part of an hourly backup system.  Instead of
shutting down all applications for the entire duration of the backup, you
can shut them down for just the second or two needed to take a snapshot.

If your goal is to protect users from accidental deletion of files,
you may want to take snapshots every hour, and leave the last few
snapshots around; users who accidentally delete a file can just look in
the snapshot.

LVM already lets administrators create snapshots, but its design has the
surprising property that every block you change on the original volume
consumes one block for each snapshot.  The resulting speed and space
penalty usually makes the use of more than one or two snapshots at a
time impractical.

Zumastor keeps all snapshots for a particular volume in a common snapshot
store, and shares blocks the way one would expect.  Thus making a
change to one block of a file in the original volume only uses one block
in the snapshot store no matter how many snapshots you have.

Remote Replication
------------------
Andrew Tridgell's rsync is a wonderful tool for replicating files remotely. 
However, when doing periodic replication of large numbers of 
infrequently changing files, the overhead for figuring out what files
need to be sent can be extreme.

Zumastor keeps track of which block change between one snapshot
and the next, and can easily send just the changed blocks.
Thus Zumastor can do periodic replication of large filesystems much more 
efficiently than rsync can.

Installing Zumastor
-------------------
Zumastor requires changes to the Linux kernel that are not yet
in the vanilla kernel, so to install it, you will either need to
patch your kernel, or download a prebuilt kernel package.

Prebuilt kernel packages for recent Debian / Ubuntu systems
are available at http://zumastor.org/downloads
