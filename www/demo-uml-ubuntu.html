<h1>Zumastor Walkthroughs</h1>

<h2>Ubuntu walkthrough on Usermode Linux</h2>

First, find an Ubuntu system with at least 3.5 gigabytes of free space!
<p>
Second, grab the Zumastor sources:
<pre>
svn checkout http://zumastor.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ zumastor
</pre>
and have a look at the files in test/uml, particularly demo.sh.
That script downloads kernel sources and a Debian system image,
then builds UML and Zumastor, and runs a bunch of simple tests
of Zumastor inside one or two UML images.
<p>
It's intended to be simple to run; the most complicated part
is that it uses sudo to get root privileges when needed.
<p>
Here's how to try it:
<pre>
cd zumastor/test/uml
bash test.sh
</pre>
<p>
It's a bit rough yet - you may see a bunch of spurious error messages,
but each test will output PASS if it finishes successfully, and
you should see "All tests complete" if everything passes.
<p>
If that works, Zumastor is set up properly in your UML instances,
and you can run individual tests outside of demo.sh.
This is a convenient way to develop and test Zumastor changes.
